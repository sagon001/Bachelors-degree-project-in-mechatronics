Here you can access a limited amount the code for my bachelors project "Payload Release System for an
Aerial Drone ". 
The code base utilizes python and MAVSDK to connect to an ardupilot drone over a telemetry radio and acces its telemetry and release a payload at the right moment.
My project report and more information can be found by reading the report at https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?dswid=-4667&pid=diva2%3A2004275&c=1&searchType=SIMPLE&language=sv&query=samuel+gonzalez+hedin&af=%5B%5D&aq=%5B%5B%5D%5D&aq2=%5B%5B%5D%5D&aqe=%5B%5D&noOfRows=50&sortOrder=author_sort_asc&sortOrder2=title_sort_asc&onlyFullText=false&sf=all or contacting me.
